You can perform many tasks in Nuclide from the keyboard. Below are the various keyboard shortcuts
available for the sets of functionality that Nuclide has to offer.

> Atom has many more keyboard shortcuts available above and beyond what Nuclide offers. To
> get a complete list of the keybindings, you can go to
> `Packages | Settings View | Show Keybindngs`.

> You can create your own [custom keybindings](/nuclide/docs/advanced-topics/custom-keybindings) beyond
> those Nuclide provides.

## Symbols

Here is a legend of symbols that are associated with the keys shown in the keybindings.

| Key | Symbol |
| ----|--------|
| `alt` or `option` on Mac | `⌥` |
| `cmd` on Mac | `⌘` |
| `ctrl` | `^` |
| `shift` | `⇧` |
| `left` | `←` |
| `up` | `↑` |
| `right` | `→` |
| `down` | `↓` |
| `backspace` | `⌫` |

If you see a `,` in a key sequence that means *then*, as in "press this sequence, then press that
sequence".

## Files

## Debugger

The Nuclide debugger attaches to a running process. The UI is built upon the Chrome Developer Tools
UI. Breakpoints are managed in the gutter to the left of your code and line numbers.

|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `option-cmd-I` | `alt-ctrl-I` | `window:toggle-dev-tools` | Toggle the developer tools UI. |

| `f9` | `f9` | `nuclide-debugger:toggle-breakpoint` | If a breakpoint is set, this will unset that breakpoint; and vice-versa. |
| `f10` | `f10` | `nuclide-debugger:step-over` | Step over a piece of code. For example, if you are stopped at a method call, this will execute that method without stepping through it line-by-line. |
| `f11` | `f11` | `nuclide-debugger:step-into` | Step into a piece of code. For example, if you are stopped at a method call, this will go into the first line of that method. |
| `shift-f11` | `shift-f11` | `nuclide-debugger:step-out` | If you have stepped into a piece of code, this will step out to the point on which you entered that piece of code. For example, if you stepped into a method, this will step out back to the method call itself. |
