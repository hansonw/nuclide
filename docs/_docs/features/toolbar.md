Nuclide customizes the [tool-bar community Atom package](https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar) for its
specific use. The toolbar provides quick launch access to many common Nuclide features including
the debugger, diff view, diagnostics, etc.

By default, the toolbar is not installed.

> Internally to Facebook the toolbar is installed by default. However, at this point, we did not
> want to presume to install other community packages without the user opting in.

## Installing

The toolbar can be installed as part of installing the
[recommended packages](/nuclide/docs/editor/setup/#post-installation__recommended-packages) through the
Nuclide package settings or it can be installed separately through the normal Atom package
installation process.

### Singular package

If you would prefer not to have all of the recommended Nuclide packages installed, you can install
the toolbar separately.

Go to `Packages | Settings View | Install Packages/Themes`. In the `Search packages` textbox, type
`tool-bar`.

![](/nuclide/static/images/docs/feature-toolbar-find-package.png)

Click `Install`.

The toolbar will be added to your Nuclide environment (normally either at the top or the left-hand
side of your Atom window).

### Toggling

You can toggle the tool bar either through `Packages | Tool Bar | Toggle` or using `cmd-option-T`
(`ctrl-alt-T`) on Linux.

## Buttons

The toolbar has buttons that, when clicked, take you to a specific feature of Nuclide.

## Uninstalling

package.
