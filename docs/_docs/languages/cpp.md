Nuclide provides support for C++ developers.

## Supported Compilers

In order to get the full features for a C++ project beyond basic syntax highlighting
and a generic autocomplete, you must have the following prerequisites installed:

1. A compatible build system. You must have one of:
     * [Buck](http://buckbuild.com) (with no additional setup required!)
     * [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - you will also have to generate a compilation database with the
       [`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
       option via command-line and place it / symlink it in your project root.
       Note that Nuclide does *not* provide any additional CMake integration at the moment.
     * You can also manually create a compliant
       [`compile_commands.json`](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
       in your project root.
2. [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.6 or higher (we recommend 3.8+)

### Installing CMake and Clang

*CMake*

You can install CMake using one of the [pre-compiled binaries](https://cmake.org/install/) for
Linux and Mac.

*Clang*

Clang is generally provided by default on all major Linux distributions. You can use your packaging
system to install it (e.g., `sudo apt-get install clang libclang`)

Note that **version 3.6 or higher is required**. We recommend 3.8 or above for best results.

> You can [build clang from source](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) on Linux as well.

On a Mac, install clang by installing [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
Xcode 7 bundles libclang 3.7 by default.

*Verify Install*

You can verify that clang is installed by typing `clang++ --version` at the command line.

> A similar install process occurs for GNU `g++`. It is provided with Xcode. And you can install
> it via a Linux package (e.g., `sudo apt-get install g++`).

*Building*

Once Clang is installed, you need to build your C++ project with `cmake`, passing in the
`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` flag. This will create a `compile_commands.json` file which lives
in the root of your project and provides the necessary information for the
[Nuclide C++ feature support](#features).

> If you use [Buck](#supported-compilers__installing-buck), you will not need to build with this
> flag.

### Installing Buck

Buck is [available](https://buckbuild.com/setup/install.html) via Homebrew on a Mac, or you can
build from source on Linux.

*Building*

Your C++ project must be set up for a Buck build by creating
[rules and targets](https://buckbuild.com/about/overview.html).

## Features

C++'s integration into Nuclide provides you with productivity features such as:

- [Code Diagnostics](#features__code-diagnostics)
- [Autocomplete](#features__autocomplete)
- [Jump To Declaration](#features__jump-to-declaration)
- [Jump Between Header and Implementation](#features__jump-between-header-and-implementation)
- [Type Hinting](#features__type-hinting)
- [Code Formatting](#features__code-formatting)

> Remember that these features are only fully-enabled when used with a
> [supported compiler](#supported-compiler).

### Code Diagnostics

If you write code that will not compile correctly, Nuclide will warn you through its
[code diagnostics](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#code-diagnostics) pane, as well with inline
[gutter](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#gutter) tooltips (represented by a sideways red triangle).

For [gutter diagnostics](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#gutter), you will sometimes see a `Fix` button. For
some common errors (e.g. missing semicolon), you can click the `Fix` button and it will fix the
problem for you.

In this example, clicking the `Fix` button will insert a semicolon for you.

### Autocomplete

Nuclide uses metadata from your Clang or Buck build to understand the objects within your project.
This allows for a detailed autocomplete feature, providing you hints on what is available for a
given object.

### Jump to Declaration

You can click on a function call for your project and be taken directly to the declaration for that
function.

Using `cmd-<mouse-click>` or `cmd-option-Enter` (`ctrl-<mouse-click>` or `ctrl-alt-Enter` on
Linux), the function call will be underlined.

Then, you will be taken to the declaration for that function.

### Jump Between Header and Implementation

Using `cmd-option-n` (`ctrl-alt-n` on Linux), you can jump between header (e.g., `.h`) and
implementation files (`.cpp`).

### Type Hinting

If you hover over a variable, Nuclide will show you a datatip with its type.

![](/nuclide/static/images/docs/language-cpp-type-hint.png)

You can even pin type hints to the [main editor](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#editing-area) so that they
are always shown.

Click on the pin on the type hint to pin the hint and the `x` to remove the pinned hint. You can
even move the type hints anywhere within the editor.

> Hovering over a pinned type hint will highlight the variable associated with it. This is useful
> if you have two pinned type hints for variables on the same line.

### Code Formatting

If you place your cursor on a function or line of code, Nuclide will format that code based on a
set of default Clang standards.

You can press `cmd-shift-c` (`ctrl-shift-c` on Linux) or use the context-aware menu and choose
`Format Code` to take a piece of code that looks like this...

... and format it like this:

## Debugging

Nuclide supports [LLDB](http://lldb.llvm.org/) as the backend for its native C++ debugging.

> At a minimum, you must have a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`) and the LLVM Debugger
> (`lldb`) installed to use this feature. For example, on a Mac, if you install
> [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with its command-line tools, these will be installed
> for you.

> Your C++ code must be compiled with debug symbols. For `g++` or `clang++`, this is accomplished
> by using `-g`. e.g., `clang++ hello.cpp -g -o hello.cpp`. If you are using `cmake` or some other
> build management system, ensure that you are compiling in debug mode with symbols.

There are three ways to invoke the LLDB debugger:

- [Attaching to a running process](#attaching-to-a-running-process)
- [Launching a process](#launching-a-process)
- [Debugging a Buck target](#debugging-a-buck-target)

### Attaching to a running process

Nuclide can attach to a running C++ process (after
[adding a C++ project](/nuclide/docs/quick-start/getting-started/#adding-a-project) to Nuclide). Once you
compile your code, run it.

Bring up the debugger target pane via `cmd-shift-Y` (`ctrl-shift-Y` on Linux).
Switch the debugging type to C++, select "Attach", and find your process in the list.

After you attach to the process, the actual Nuclide Debugger appears.
You can then debug your code normally, [following the Debugger guide](/nuclide/docs/features/debugger/#basics).

### Launching a process

Launching a process is similar to the "Attach" flow - bring up the debugger pane
and select "Launch" from the Action dropdown, then fill out the fields.

### Debugging a Buck target

See the [Buck guide](/nuclide/docs/features/buck#debug) for instructions on how to debug C++ Buck targets.

### LLDB Commands

You can run LLDB commands directly in the Nuclide debugger
[console](/nuclide/docs/features/debugger#basics__evaluation).
