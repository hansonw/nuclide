Nuclide has deep, built in support for [Flow-enabled](http://flowtype.org) JavaScript.

> Currently, Flow is [not supported on Windows](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/6), so this
> integration is not yet available on that platform.

## Installing Flow

In order to fully use the integration of Flow, you must have Flow installed on your system:

1. [Install Flow](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html#installing-flow).
2. If you are new to Flow, you can [follow the steps for writing simple Flow programs](http://flowtype.org/docs/five-simple-examples.html). The
key items of note are:
   * `flow` is on your `$PATH`. If it is not on your `$PATH` for any reason, you can specify the
   path to the `flow` binary in `Settings | Packages | Nuclide | Settings |
   nuclide-flow: Path to Flow Executable`.
   * You have an empty `.flowconfig` file in the root of your project.
   * You have `/* @flow */` at the top of your JavaScript (`.js`) file.

## Features

Flow's integration into Nuclide provides you with productivity features such as:

* [Code Diagnostics](#features__code-diagnostics) (e.g., Flow errors inline)
* [Autocomplete](#features__autocomplete)
* [Jump to Definition](#features__jump-to-definition)
* [Inline (mouse over) typehinting](#features__type-hinting)

> These features will not work properly unless you are working with Flow-enabled JavaScript since
> they require a `.flowconfig` file in your project root and the ability to run the Flow
> typechecker (e.g., `flow`) from the project root.

### Code Diagnostics

If you write code that will not pass the Flow typechecker, Nuclide will provide you error details in
both its [code diagnostics](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#status-bar__code-diagnostics) pane and inline
within the [main text editor](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#editing-area).

Hover over the sideways red triangle in the [gutter](/nuclide/docs/editor/basics/#gutter) to see the Flow
error inline.

### Autocomplete
​​
Given that Nuclide has access to all of the type information within your project along with the
built-in types provided by Flow, autocomplete just works.

### Jump To Definition

Nuclide provides a jump to definition/symbol feature for Flow programs.

For example, if you want to go to the definition of `arr_length()`, you will hover over
`arr_length()`and either press `cmd-<mouse click>` (`ctrl-<mouse click>` on Linux) or
`cmd-option-Enter` (`ctrl-alt-Enter` on Linux).

### Type Hinting

If you hover over a variable in your Flow file, you can get the type of the variable directly
inline.

In fact, you can even pin that type hint so that it always shows as well. Just click on the pin
when hovering over a variable and it will be pinned.

The highlighted variables show that their type variables have been pinned. If you hover over the
type hint, its associated variable will have motion in its highlight.

Click the `x` to remove the pinned type hint.

> Pinned type hints can be moved anywhere within the editor.

## Debugging

The debugging of Flow through Node is a cornerstone of Nuclide. It serves as the example for
the [debugger](/nuclide/docs/features/debugger/) at large, and is
[described there](/nuclide/docs/features/debugger/#basics).
