# Build settings
# Github pages now only supports Kramdown and Rouge
# https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0
# So no need to be explicit with respect to our markdown and highlighter settings since they
# cannot change.
# kramdown also automatically generates header ID's too. But we remove any auto id suffix
# in a post processing step (js/jekyll-link-anchors.js) to make the links more readable.

# For local development and testing, explicitly set kramdown settings that GitHub does
# https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#defaults-you-can-change
